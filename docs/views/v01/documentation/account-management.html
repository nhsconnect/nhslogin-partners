  <p>We aim to make the NHS login Service account management capabilities self-service for the user wherever possible. The Service currently includes a feature that enables users to reset their NHS login password on a self-serve basis.</p>

  <p>Additionally, we intend to deliver the capability for users to change their email address and/or their 2FA mobile number online by our Public Beta, March 2019.</p>
