    <p>It is intended that NHS login will support delegated access. This functionality will allow an individual to access the accounts of children or adults and act on their behalf, subject to stringent authorisation processes.</p>

    <p>Whilst this capability is already on the roadmap for development, we would welcome the opportunity to work with an appropriate RPs to establish the requirements for this functionality and thus provide an optimised capability.</p>
