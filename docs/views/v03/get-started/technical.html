    <p><strong>Stub</strong>
    <br />This is a lightweight representation of our OIDC endpoints.
    <br />It is useful as a developer learning exercise and usable for partner test/dev environments - where NHS login is not part of the test case.</p>

    <p><strong>Sandpit</strong>
    <br />This is a copy of our production code, without integration to our backend systems: PDS and GP systems for linkage key retrieval.
    <br />As it doesn’t have entry criteria, anyone can plugin NHS login into their service to see how it visually and technically works.
    <br />Doing this will make the move to Assurance and Production technically straightforward.
    <br />It isn’t intended as a test environment, so we don’t add lots of data, or approve any ID check submissions.</p>

    <p><strong>Assurance</strong>
    <br />As sandpit, expect linked to PDS INT/DEV (as required).
    <br />Used by partners to be sure test cases are handled as expected. Can be loaded with test accounts as required. NHS login will check a partner has completed a successful end to end test before moving into PROD.</p>
