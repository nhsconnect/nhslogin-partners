    <p>We are considering a journey whereby a trusted individual (e.g. a Health and Social Care professional) can create an account through NHS login on behalf of a citizen, an approach known as “Vouching”.  In this case, the “Voucher” takes the responsibility for verifying that the citizen is who they say they are.</p>

    <p>This capability is in the early stages of design and is provisionally scheduled for delivery in 2019. The assistance of appropriate RPs in developing the requirements in this area would be valuable.</p>
