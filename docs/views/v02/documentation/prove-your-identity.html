  <p>To prove their identity online (PYI) using NHS login, a user must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upload a copy of a photo ID document. Admissible documents include:
      <ul>
        <li>UK passports</li>
        <li>UK provisional and full driving licences</li>
        <!--<li>Non-UK passports</li>
        <li>EEA/EU driving licences</li>
        <li>EEA/EU identity cards</li>-->
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All documents must meet international, government or European Directive standards.</li>
    <li>Upload a short video of themselves reading 4 randomly generated numbers out loud; and</li>
    <li>Give the postcode of the GP surgery where they are registered plus either their name and date of birth or their NHS number.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once this information is submitted by the user, our Home Office trained ID Checkers, will verify the userâ€™s identity. This is done by checking the ID submitted is valid, checking the user is the same person on that ID using the video they submit of themselves, and running a search, using the information provided, to find a match on the NHS Personal Demographics Service (PDS) and attaching their NHS Number to their NHS login account.</p>

  <p>We aim to complete this process within 2 hours of the user uploading their information.</p>
