  <h2>Use our stub to learn about OpenID Connect</h2>
  <p>Our stub is a lightweight representation of our OpenID Connect (OIDC) implementation. It is intended to provide rapid learning of how our OIDC authorization flow behaves.</p>

  <p>The sandpit environment will help you learn how to integrate with our service. However, it doesn't offer a full experience. The key restrictions are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not possible to complete submitted ID verification checks, only a basic registration</li>
    <li>Its not connected to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can see a development plan for the sandpit on this user story map.</p>
  <p>Our support team can add test data to the sandpit for you - weâ€™ll send you their details when we setup your sandpit access.</p>
