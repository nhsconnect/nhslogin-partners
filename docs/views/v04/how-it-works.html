      </h1>
      <p>NHS login is an internet facing system for identifying and verifying a user’s identity.</p>
      <p>It uses the <a target="blank" href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">Open ID Connect</a> and the <a target="blank" href="https://oauth.net/2/">Oauth2.0</a> protocols. It also uses <a target="blank" href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">FIDO (Fast Identity Online) specifications</a>  which improves the user’s experience by allowing Fingerprint ID and Face ID to seamlessly access native apps.</p>
      <p>NHS login offers different levels and combinations of verification and authentication so you can choose the most appropriate for your service.</p>
      <p><a href="how-it-works/authentication-verification">Find out more about the levels we currently support, and what we intend to support in future</a></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>User signs up to a service</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Creates an NHS log in</strong>
        <p>If the user does not already have an NHS login account they will be asked to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>set up their account by entering their email address and password.</li>
            <li>provide a mobile phone number to which they are sent a 4-digit code which they must enter as part of the 2FA process.</li>
            <li>accept the NHS login Service Terms and Conditions of use</li>

        <p>At this point, the user will have a basic NHS login account which will allow them access to generic NHS services and information which do not contain personalised and potentially sensitive data.</p>
        <p>If the user requires access to services that make use of personal information, then they must verify their identity to the level required by the partner service.</p>

        <p>To verify their identity, a user can either:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A. Use NHS login services to prove their identity online</li>
            <li>B. Use NHS login services and opt to re-use their existing GP Patient OnLine linkage key information to prove who they are.</li>

        <li><strong>ID verification</strong>
        <p>Once this information is submitted by the user, our Home Office trained ID Checkers, will verify the user’s identity. This is done by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>checking the ID submitted is valid</li>
            <li>checking the user is the same person on that ID using the video they submit of themselves</li>
            <li>running a search to find a match on the NHS Personal Demographics Service (PDS)</li>
            <li>attaching their NHS Number to their NHS login account.</li>
