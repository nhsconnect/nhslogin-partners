    <h2>1. Check if you need NHS login</h2>
    <p>Before you start connecting your service to NHS login, find out <a href="../how-it-works">how NHS login works</a> and <a href="../why-use-nhs-login#isitright">if it’s right for your service</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Choose your ‘Vector of Trust'</h2>
    <p>You will need to determine the <a href="../how-it-works/authentication-verification#vot">‘Vector of Trust’</a> for your service. This is the minimum level of user verification that you should be willing to accept before providing a user with access to your service.</p>
    <p>As part of the assurance process we’ll ask that you’ve gone through this process.</p>

    <h2>3. Develop in the Sandpit</h2>
    <p>The Sandpit is a copy of our production code environment which will help you learn how to integrate with our service. Developing in the Sandpit is a mandatory step before a service can be onboarded.</p>

    <p>The Sandpit can be accessed from the <a href="https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhslogin/" target="blank">NHS login GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Begin preparation for ‘Supplier conformance assessment’</h2>
