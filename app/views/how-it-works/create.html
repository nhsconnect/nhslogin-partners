      <ol>
        <li><strong>User signs up to a service</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Creates an NHS log in</strong><br />If the user does not already have an NHS login account they will be asked to:

          <ul>
            <li>set up their account by entering their email address and password.</li>
            <li>provide a mobile phone number to which they are sent a 4-digit code which they must enter as part of the 2FA process.</li>
            <li>accept the NHS login Service Terms and Conditions of use</li>
          </ul>
      
        <br />At this point, the user will have a basic NHS login account which will allow them access to generic NHS services and information which do not contain personalised and potentially sensitive data.
        <br />If the user requires access to services that make use of personal information, then they must verify their identity to the level required by the partner service.

        <br />To verify their identity, a user can either:
          <ul>
            <li>Use NHS login services to prove their identity online (referred to as Prove Your Identity (PYI)); or</li>
            <li>Use NHS login services and opt to re-use their existing GP Patient OnLine linkage key information (POL) to prove who they are.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
