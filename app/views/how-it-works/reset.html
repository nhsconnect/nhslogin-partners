     <!-- <p>NHS login is an internet facing system for identifying and verifying a user’s identity.</p>
      <p>It uses the <a target="blank" href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">Open ID Connect</a> and the <a target="blank" href="https://oauth.net/2/">Oauth2.0 protocols</a>. It also uses <a target="blank" href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">FIDO (Fast Identity Online) specifications</a>  which improves the user’s experience by allowing Fingerprint ID and Face ID seamlessly access native apps.</p>
      <p>NHS login offers different levels of verification so you can choose the most appropriate for your service. To determine the right level of verification, review the guidance within the standards to understand the policy for the transactions within your service.</p>

      <h2>Management of NHS login Accounts</h2>
      <p>We aim to make the NHS login Service account management capabilities self-service for the user wherever possible. The Service currently includes a feature that enables users to reset their NHS login password on a self-serve basis.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we intend to deliver the capability for users to change their email address and/or their 2FA mobile number online by our Public Beta.</p>
