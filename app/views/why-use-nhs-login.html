      <p>If you’re building a health or social care app or website for patients, NHS login is a flexible solution which can take away the headache of creating an account for a user, verifying the user’s identity, and linking it to their NHS number.</p>

      <p>NHS login is designed and funded for Health and Social Care services. It provides user verification facilities and the creation of a user account that can be used to login to other Health and Social Care Services.</p>

      <p>If your service aligns to NHS strategy and delivers benefits to the NHS and social care ecosystem you can apply to use NHS login to check a user’s identity.</p>

      <p>Your service might need to do this if it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>shows a user personal information about themselves, such as their medical records</li>
        <li>replaces a form that needs to be physically signed by a user</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The team behind NHS login work in a user-centred, agile way. As such, the service will be continually improved via iterative releases that have been validated via user research and testing.</p>

        <li>Users need a form of Government ID</li>

        <li>Delegated access (ie parent / child or vulnerable individual) isn’t currently supported but it is on our roadmap</li>
        <li>Your service and organisation will need to meet our assurance requirements and sign our contract</li>
        <li>If you’re supplying a service to an organisation, they will need to sign End User Organisation Declaration</li>
        <li>Clinical authorisation remains the responsibility of the partner service</li>
