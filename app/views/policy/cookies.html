		<p>We use Hotjar analytic to collect information about how you use our platform, for example the steps you make, what you click and when you leave. This helps us identify what doesnâ€™t work so we can improve it.</p>
		<p>These tools do not collect or store your personal information (for example your name or address). This means we cannot identify who you are.</p>
		<p>We do not allow Hotjar to use or share our analytics data.</p>

		<p>Hotjar will be use to set the following cookies: </p>

		<div class="cookie-table">
			<table>
				<thead>
				    <tr>
					    <th>Name</th>
					    <th>Purpose</th>
					    <th>Expires</th>
				    </tr>

				<tbody>
				    <tr>
					    <td><b>_hjShownFeedbackMessage</b></td>
					    <td><p>This is set when you complete feedback or minimise the feedback option.</p>
					    	<p>It keeps the feedback option minimised so you do not see it open when you go to another page.</p></td>
					    <td>1 year</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
					    <td><b>_hjIncludedInSample</b></td>
					    <td>This is set to tell Hotjar if you are included in a sample of user journeys used to generate heatmaps and funnels (ways to display data), and recordings.</td>
