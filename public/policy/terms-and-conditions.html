If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and exclusions and limits of liability, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in effect (and if any of the sub-clauses in clause 5.3 of these Terms of Use are held to be invalid and are struck out then this shall not impact on any of the remaining sub-clauses).</li><li>Even if we delay in enforcing these Terms of Use, we can still enforce them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms of Use, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking these Terms of Use, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</li><li>The laws of England shall apply exclusively to these Terms of Use and to all matters relating to use of the website. Any cause of action arising under these Terms of Use or the use of the website shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England.</li><li>We may, at any time and in our sole discretion, amend these Terms of Use for any reason. For example: to comply with law; changes to the website including new features on the website. The latest version of our Terms of Use will be accessible through the website and we will notify you of any material changes through a notice via the website so you can then elect to refresh your consent.</li></ol></li><p class="small"><em>Last updated: 26th April 2019</em></p></ol><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){
